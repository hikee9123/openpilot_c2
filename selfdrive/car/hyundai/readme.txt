    1.1 lateralTuning.indi.actuatorEffectiveness
      As effectiveness increases, actuation strength decreases 
      Too high: weak, sloppy lane centering, slow oscillation, can't follow high curvature, high steering error causes snappy corrections 
      Too low: overpower, saturation, jerky, fast oscillation 
      Just right: Highest still able to maintain good lane centering. 

    1.2 lateralTuning.indi.timeConstant 
      Extend exponential decay of prior output steer 
      Too high: sloppy lane centering 
      Too low: noisy actuation, responds to every bump, maybe unable to maintain lane center due to rapid actuation 
      Just right: above noisy actuation and lane centering instability 
    
    1.3 lateralTuning.indi.innerLoopGain 
      Steer rate error gain 
      Too high: jerky oscillation in high curvature 
      Too low: sloppy, cannot accomplish desired steer angle 
      Just right: brief snap on entering high curvature 

    1.4 lateralTuning.indi.outerLoopGain 
      Steer error gain 
      Too high: twitchy hyper lane centering, oversteering 
      Too low: sloppy, all over lane 
      Just right: crisp lane centering
